# Evaluating LLMs as Participant Simulators for Behavioral Science

This repository accompanies the commentary paper  
**_‚ÄúEvaluating LLMs as Participant Simulators for Behavioral Science‚Äù_**.

It contains the data and code used to evaluate the three cognitive tasks discussed in the paper:

- **Reverse Learning**
- **Horizon Task**
- **Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)**

---

## Repository Structure

Each task has its own folder, which includes:

- The **data** used for the task (e.g., participant timelines) and **data** generated by task.
- The **notebooks** for the evaluation of generative/predictive performance of all models used.
- The **notebooks** for recreating the final figures.
